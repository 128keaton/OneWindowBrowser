Simple proof of concept Cocoa (WebKit) browser GUI, which runs on Jaguar 10.2.x through to High Sierra 10.13.x

Download pre-compiled builds (.zip) or
    Build Xcode v2.5 project file on Tiger for 10.2 through to 10.5 (PowerPC and Universal Binary).
    Build Xcode v8 project file on El Cap or higher for 10.6 through to 10.13 (x86_64)

Features:
  * Java and plugins are disabled.
  * Defaults to iPad OS 3.2.2 User Agent (defaults to load most mobile sites).
  * Back/Forward controls and History menu remains non-persistent (Private) between launches.
  * Window can be faded in or out (alpha transparency).
  * Last visited URL persists between app launches.
  * Text size and window frame (and transparency) persists between launches.
 
Note: Although this browser may run on your system, it doesn't introduce anything new in terms of capability or compatibility. If a website doesn't load in Safari, it probably won't load in this browser.
